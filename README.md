## Installation
**Statamic** is a flat-file CMS, which means all the data is stored in the git repository. Before pushing the code to **Kinsta Application Hosting**, you have to [install it locally](https://statamic.dev/installing) and create a super user account. After doing this, commit and push all the changes to the repository.

Remember that **Kinsta Application Hosting** works best for stateless applications, which means that it will be best to work on your content locally and use **Kinsta** just to serve the website to users.

## Dependency Management
**Statamic** is based on Laravel. This means that it's a regular PHP-based application, so during the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `composer.json` file.

## Environment Variables
Note that **Statamic** requires few environment variables to be set:
- `APP_KEY` - you can get the `APP_KEY` either by running `php artisan key:generate` locally or use [this generator](https://generate-random.org/laravel-key-generator)
- `APP_KINSTA` - set it `true`.

## Required buildpacks
> **Warning**
> Your first deploy will fail in most cases because it won't have all the required **Buildbacks**. Remember to set them up after the first deployment.

In most cases we want our application to also build our CSS/JS files we need to add two Buildpacks:
- Node.js
- PHP

## Web Server Setup
When deploying an application Kinsta will automatically create a web process with `heroku-php-apache2 public/`. It can be later altered in the `Processes` tab in the UI.

## What is Statamic?
Statamic is a powerful, flat-file CMS built on Laravel.

### Key Features
- There’s no database until you need one.
- It’s a front-to-back CMS until you need to go headless.
- It’s dynamically powered by PHP & Laravel until you need to go static.
- It’s full-stack until you go JAMstack.
- Host it on any modern PHP server until you want to go serverless.
- Use the control panel unless you don’t feel like it. Code editors are great too.
- You can version control everything unless you don’t want to.
